! Jcode.pm
  * Minor pod fixes
  * More field test at http://openlab.jp/Jcode/ before the official release

1.99_03 2005/02/13
! Jcode.pm
  Addressed a bug that Jcode did not handle 'binary' correctly,
  reported by Takahashi-san
+ t/append.t
  Surprisingly, append() was not in the test suite so there.
! Jcode.pm
  * $j->any_encoding feature added via AUTOLOAD.
  * More testings
  * Pod revisions

1.99_02 2005/02/12
- Unicode/_test.pl
  This file was totally unnecessary but got installed via MakeMaker
  so it is now removed from MANIFEST
! Makefile.PL
  Now smarter so that only Jcode.pm is build and installed 
  when appropriate (when your perl is 5.8.1 or better).
