To install
==========

Unix with a compiler
--------------------

  Do the following via web

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

On a Macs
---------

  Run "Mac_Install.PL" just once.  Make sure you have "site_perl"
  folder where your MacPerl folder resides.  If not, create one before
  you run this script.

Mac, Win, RedHat  Linux with just default packages installed...
---------------------------------------------------------------
(or any other platforms where no compiler is available)

  Just copy Jcode.pm and Jcode directory (folder) into perl's lib
directory.

* On Macs, that's "lib" folder or "site_perl" folder in the same
  folder where MacPerl is installed.
* Ditto for Windows (I think.  Correct me if I am wrong).

  To find where the heck that lib folder is, run this small perl
  script.

  print join("\n", @INC);
